##### Explain to me `synchronized(this)` in Java

In Java, the `synchronized` keyword is used to acquire a lock on an object. When a thread executes a synchronized method or block, it acquires a lock on the object and other threads are not able to enter any synchronized methods or blocks of the same object until the lock is released. Here is an example of using the `synchronized` keyword in a method: 
```java 
public class Counter {
	private int count = 0; 
	public synchronized void increment() { 
		count++; 
	}
}
```

In this example, the `increment` method is synchronized, which means that only one thread can execute it at a time. If multiple threads try to call the `increment` method at the same time, only one of them will be able to acquire the lock and execute the method, while the others will have to wait until the lock is released.

The `synchronized` keyword can also be used in a block of code, like this:
```java
public class Counter {
    private int count = 0;

    public void increment() {
        synchronized (this) {
            count++;
        }
    }
}
```

In this example, the block of code within the `synchronized` statement will be treated as a critical section, and only one thread will be able to enter it at a time. The `this` keyword refers to the current object, which is used as the lock.

The `synchronized` keyword is often used to ensure that access to shared resources is properly synchronized between multiple threads, in order to prevent race conditions and other concurrency issues.

##### What is `this.notify()`?

`this.notify()` is a method in Java that wakes up a single thread that is waiting on the current object. It is used in conjunction with the `wait` method, which allows a thread to wait for a certain condition to be met.

Here is an example of how `wait` and `notify` might be used:

```java
public class MyClass {
    private boolean flag = false;

    public synchronized void doWait() {
        while (!flag) {
            try {
                wait();
            } catch (InterruptedException e) {
                // handle interruption
            }
        }
    }

    public synchronized void doNotify() {
        flag = true;
        notify();
    }
}
```

In this example, the `doWait` method uses the `wait` method to block the current thread until the `flag` variable is set to `true`. The `doNotify` method sets the `flag` variable to `true` and then calls `notify` to wake up any threads that are waiting on the object.

It is important to note that the `wait` and `notify` methods must be called from within a synchronized block or method, in order to ensure that the correct lock is acquired.

The `notify` method wakes up a single thread, while the `notifyAll` method wakes up all threads that are waiting on the object. It is generally better to use `notifyAll` instead of `notify`, since it avoids the "lost wakeup" problem, where a thread might miss the notification if it is not awakened.
